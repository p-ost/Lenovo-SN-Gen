**Hello, the code in this repo is for a Lenovo Serial Number GEN + Checker**  
The code is very basic, just has api requests and response parsing lol. I could've made a gui for it but I got lazy.  


**Why did I make this?**  
The main reason I made this wasn't to scam lenovo or anything of that sorts. I made this script to make fun of a dude  
on cracked.io for selling one for $60. **This again is very basic I do plan to make it more advanced if I get bored**
